A decentralized service for paid content distribution that leverages the power of the Lightning Network to facilitate atomic and trust-free transactions for any digital content purchase. 
By utilizing Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK proofs), we ensure that each transaction is not only verifiable but also secure under the protection of L1/L2 blockchain solutions.
